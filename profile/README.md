# Sunday Service Spinning Society

Sunday Service has grown into a large, thriving community with many talented musicians and great people.  However, as the scale of the event has increased, the amount of work it takes to keep things running smoothly has increased as well.  There are lots of technical parts to manage, tasks to take care of, and communications that have to be made with the community.  The purpose of this github organization is to organize our documentation, automate work that can be automated, and to hopefully provide a single place where hardworking volunteers can quickly know what needs to be done to make the magic happen.

### General Rules:

* Use the github project to track what you are working on.  This is just to avoid doubling up on work.
* You're free to drop a task at any time if you don't want to finish it out, but make sure to set it back to "ready to be picked up"
* Try to Automate, but don't try to obfuscate.  Organizers should be able to inject their own brand and ideas when performing a task if they would like.
* Absolutely NO sensitive data.
* Performers and users should not have to take any extra tasks themselves.
