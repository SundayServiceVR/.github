# Sunday Service Spinning Society

Sunday Service has grown into a large, thriving community with many talented musicians and great people.  However, as the scale of the event has increased, the amount of work it takes to keep things running smoothly has increased as well.  There are lots of technical parts to manage, tasks to take care of, and communications that have to be made with the community.  The purpose of this github organization is to organize our documentation, automate work that can be automated, and to hopefully provide a single place where hardworking volunteers can quickly know what needs to be done to make the magic happen.

### Ideas for General Rules:

* Try to Automate, but don't try to obfuscate.  Organizers should be able to inject their own brand and ideas when performing a task if they would like.
* Absolutely NO sensitive data.
* Performers should not have to take any extra tasks themselves.

### Things that we need today:

* We should ask for help from the community.  We are moving at a pretty good pace right now, but more people also means more diverse ideas, and a boost in speed is always great if it happens to work out that way.
* Identify what ideas are worth tackling first.  Identify ideas that may not be worth the effort.
* Decide if we want to offer our systems for other clubs or keep it to our own home.
* Decide if we want to offer performers to sign up and manage their own data, or if we should keep this to event managers only.
* Offer to get the whiteboard released.
